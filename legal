	By using our service, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age. No one under the age of 16 may use the Service, except as set forth as follows.
</p>

<p>Momentum is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. If you are under the age of 16 you must receive consent from a parent, guardian and/or an authorized school official to use the Service. Momentum relies on parents and guardians to ensure that minors only use Momentum if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an authorized school official in the United States or in the EU and want your students, who are under the age of 16, to create Momentum accounts, you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;) and, to the extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&quot;FERPA&quot;), or the GDPR policy, respectively. This means that you must notify the students&#39; parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information that Momentum will collect, and that you will obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use Momentum. When obtaining such consent, you must provide their parents or guardians with a copy of our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and keep all consents on file and provide them to us upon request.</p>

<p>For more information on complying with COPPA, see <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm">the Federal Trade Commission&#39;s website</a>. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely on you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws, and, as a condition to your and your students&#39; use of Momentum, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such laws.</p>

<p>If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, without the consent of a parent, guardian and/or an authorized school official, we will delete the child’s account and information. If you are aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided Momentum with personal information without the consent of a parent, guardian and/or an authorized school official, please contact Momentum support.</p>
